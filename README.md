# File-Transfer-Application (2017)

> Tools - Java

## About

A Java application for sending and receiving documents between two machines over a network. This project was made to demonstrate the learnings imbibed from the OOP course during my undergraduate studies.

## Execution

The entire parent folder can be imported as an Intellij project and the FTP.class file can be executed. Do note that JavaFx SDK, may need to be imported for the code to run. Also, an executable jar file can be found inside *out/artifacts/*

## Packages Used

-	Java.io: To read/write a file.
-	Java.net: To create a socket connection for sending files through it.
- Javax.swing: To provide a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Limitations and Future Scope

This application is Operating System independent and, can be used to transfer any type of files between two systems at a time, however, the systems are supposed to be on the same network. It could be possible to extend the same for exchanging files between machines on different networks. Also, some features and the GUI could be more enhanced. This could also be extended to involving multiple machines.
